# Preston Davis Final Project - Solar App

This app uses vite + React and some react libraries to help with development. I went with react because it is a framework I have used in the past and it makes life easier when setting up your front-end.

The goal of this app is to help visualize the amount of money I am saving (or losing) on electricity because of the decision I made to install solar panels on my home.
